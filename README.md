The Dataset: 
The images is taken from different datasets in github, where the indoor dataset is taken from https://github.com/Divya14473/Indoor-Scene-Recognition/tree/main, and images from  outdoor dataset is from https://github.com/RenYang-home/Natural-Scene-Memorability/tree/master. We have asked and gotten permisson from the owners of the outdoor dataset to - -use it.
